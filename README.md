# 2nd-Grade-Math--Sum-to-1000-
This is a fun math game involving dragging and dropping cards.
This is great for 2nd Grade math skills and is the 2nd ever program that I have made.
The concept of the game is to take 6 given cards and arrange them into two 3-digit numbers in an
 attempt to get a sum as close to 1000 as possible.
